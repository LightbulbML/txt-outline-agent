### 2. System.

#### 2.1 Substrates.

- Element: Substrates (detailed description)
  - Function: Each substrate of the system preferably functions to support one or more RF absorption sheets, and can additionally or alternatively be configured to support any other suitable elements of the system.
  - The substrate is preferably lightweight (e.g., employing a small amount of material, such as defining a structure with many voids and/or openings, rather than a continuous or substantially continuous sheet-like structure) and/or minimally occlusive (e.g., having significant open space such that the interference of the substrate with airflow, such as airflow driven by one or more rotary wings, is negligible, minimized, and/or below a threshold value), such as shown by way of example in FIGURES 4A–4C.
  - The substrate is preferably flexible.
    - Example: the substrate can include (e.g., be made of) one or more flexible materials, such as flexible polymers (e.g., polyimide).
  - However, the substrate can additionally or alternatively include any other suitable materials.
  - In some examples, the substrate includes one or more gridlines (e.g., flexible gridlines, such as made from or including one or more flexible polymers).
    - Element: Gridlines (one or more)
      - Example: these gridlines can define a rectangular array (e.g., square array) with open space between the gridlines (e.g., as shown in FIGURES 4A and/or 4B).
  - The substrate can optionally include one or more frames (e.g., circumferential frames).
    - Element: Frames (one or more, optional)
      - In a first example, the substrate includes a rigid frame (e.g., which can function to retain the substrate in a particular configuration).
      - In a second example, the substrate includes a flexible frame, such as a flexible frame configured to exert tensile forces on the interior material (e.g., on the flexible gridlines).
        - In this example, the flexible frame can be operable to make the substrate tend toward an open arrangement (e.g., as opposed to a closed and/or stowed arrangement, such as a folded and/or rolled arrangement), such as a planar or substantially planar arrangement.
      - However, the substrate can additionally or alternatively include any other suitable frames.
  - The substrate is preferably configured to attach mechanically to a device with which the system will be integrated, such as to a vehicle.
    - As described above, the vehicle is preferably an aerial vehicle (e.g., rotary wing vehicle, such as a quadcopter), wherein the device is preferably configured to reduce interference with vehicle operation (e.g., minimize aerodynamic drag, minimize interference with rotary wing operations, such as minimizing occlusion of rotor downdraft, etc.).
  - Further, the substrate is preferably configured to electrically connect to the device (e.g., vehicle) and/or the electrical equipment attached thereto (e.g., connecting an electrical output of the wireless power receiver to the device and/or electrical equipment attached thereto).
  - In some embodiments, the system (e.g., the substrate(s) thereof) can be operable to transition between a stowed configuration and a deployed configuration.
    - In the stowed configuration, the system is preferably configured to reduce or minimize its effect on vehicle (e.g., aerial vehicle such as rotary wing vehicle) operation, such as reducing the system's aerodynamic drag and/or interference with vehicle propulsion and/or control mechanisms (e.g., interference with airflow before and/or interaction with one or more wings and/or control surfaces, such as interference with airflow caused by rotation of one or more rotary wings).
      - In examples, in the stowed configuration, the system (and/or elements thereof) can be folded, rolled, and/or otherwise stowed.
    - In the deployed configuration, the system is preferably able to efficiently receive power wirelessly (e.g., while still ensuring that its effect on vehicle operation is sufficiently low), such as by being configured in a substantially flat or planar configuration and/or being configured in a substantially maximum area configuration (e.g., a configuration in which the footprint of the substrate and/or the impedance sheets have the maximum area possible, or close to the maximum area possible), having a frame in a substantially convex configuration, and/or the like.
      - In examples, in the deployed configuration, the system (and/or elements thereof) can be unfolded, unrolled, and/or otherwise deployed.
    - However, the system can additionally or alternatively be operable to transition between any other suitable configurations.
  - Further, the system can additionally or alternatively include any other suitable substrates having any suitable configurations and/or functionalities.

#### 2.2 Wireless power receiver.

- Element: Wireless power receiver (detailed description)
  - Function: The wireless power receiver preferably functions to receive RF power transmitted wirelessly (e.g., transmitted via one or more propagating modes, preferably not via evanescent modes, but additionally or alternatively, via one or more evanescent modes).
  - Example: the wireless power receiver can include one or more elements such as described in U.S. Patent Application 18,674,945, filed 27-MAY-2024 and titled "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR WIRELESS POWER RECEPTION", which is herein incorporated in its entirety by this reference (e.g., wherein the wireless power receiver includes the 'system 100 for wireless power reception' as described therein or any suitable elements thereof, such as wherein the wireless power receiver includes one or more 'antennas 110' and/or 'RF–DC converters 130' defined on the one or more substrates).
  - In some examples, the wireless power receiver can be configured to operate such as described in U.S. Patent Application 18/891,137, filed 20-SEP-2024 and titled "METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR WIRELESS POWER DELIVERY", which is herein incorporated in its entirety by this reference (e.g., wherein the wireless power receiver can be configured to operated such as described therein regarding the 'receiver').
  - The wireless power receiver preferably includes a plurality of RF impedance sheets, more preferably including exactly two such sheets.
    - Element: RF impedance sheets (plurality)
  - However, the wireless power receiver can alternatively include more than two impedance sheets, can include only a single impedance sheet, and/or can include any suitable number of impedance sheets.
  - Each impedance sheet is preferably attached to (e.g., defined on) a substrate of the system.
    - In a first example, the receiver includes multiple impedance sheets defined on a single substrate (e.g., including two total sheets, each defined on an opposing side of a single substrate).
    - In a second example, the receiver can include impedance sheets defined on different substrates (e.g., including one impedance sheet defined on each substrate, such as one sheet on each of two total substrates of the system).
    - In a third example, the receiver can include both multiple sheets defined on a single substrate (e.g., defined on opposing sides of the substrate), and sheets defined on different substrates (e.g., wherein one or more additional substrates can each include a single impedance sheet, can each include two impedance sheets defined on opposing sides of the substrate, etc.).
    - However, the sheets can additionally or alternatively be arranged on the substrate(s) in any other suitable manner.
  - The spacing defined between the impedance sheets (e.g., spacing between substantially parallel substantially planar sheets) is preferably small, as a reduced spacing between the sheets can function to achieve a high quality factor for the wireless power receiver (resulting in a correspondingly narrow bandwidth).
    - Example: the spacing between the sheets can be defined by the thickness of a substrate on which two sheets are defined (e.g., on opposing sides of the substrate), such as being in a range of tens of microns (e.g., 10 µm, 20 µm, 50 µm, etc.).
    - However, the impedance sheets can additionally or alternatively have any other suitable arrangement relative to each other.
  - Each impedance sheet preferably includes a plurality of RF elements, such as dipole elements (e.g., as shown in FIGURE 5), resonant elements (e.g., antenna elements), such as loop resonators, and the like.
    - Element: RF elements (plurality)
  - The RF elements are preferably arranged in a regular (or substantially regular) array, such as an array defined by the substrate (e.g., by the gridlines thereof), such as shown by way of example in FIGURES 7A–7B, which depict an RF impedance sheet including a two-by-two array of dipole elements.
  - More generally, the RF elements preferably are arranged on (e.g., defined on) the substrate without occluding the open space defined by the substrate, and accordingly, the RF elements preferably are arranged substantially along any gridlines and/or other structures defined by the substrate (e.g., as shown in FIGURE 6).
  - However, the RF elements can additionally or alternatively have any other suitable arrangement.
  - The RF elements (e.g., of a single impedance sheet or any suitable subset thereof) preferably define a connected array, wherein the different RF elements are electromagnetically coupled to each other.
    - Example: an impedance sheet can include a plurality of dipole elements, each connected to neighboring dipoles at their ends (e.g., at the current nodes of the dipoles).
  - The connected array preferably provides for DC coupling between the coupled elements, but more preferably does not provide for RF coupling between these elements (e.g., thereby preventing emergence of multi-mode functionality in the impedance sheet).
  - To achieve such coupling, the connected array can include one or more additional structures (e.g., arranged at or near the current nodes at which the different elements are connected).
    - Element: Additional structures (one or more)
      - In examples, these structures can include inductive structures (e.g., inductors configured to provide DC coupling, but not RF coupling), harmonic matching structures, such as structures configured to preserve odd harmonics, but destroy or substantially destroy even harmonics (e.g., one or more parasitic structures, such as notches, cuts, stubs, and the like), and/or any other suitable structures.
  - The RF elements of an impedance sheet can be connected (e.g., connected for DC, but preferably not for RF) in series and/or in parallel.
    - Example: a plurality of RF elements can be connected in series to their neighbors along one direction of an array (e.g., wherein the array includes end-to-end connections between neighboring dipoles), wherein different sets of series-connected elements (e.g., different rows of series-connected dipoles) are connected in parallel.
    - However, the impedance sheets can additionally or alternatively include any other suitable electrical couplings and/or connections.
  - The impedance sheets (and/or any suitable subset thereof, such as any two impedance sheets) are preferably configured to achieve substantially zero transmission and substantially unity absorption at a particular design wavelength (e.g., a specific RF wavelength).
    - Example: the RF elements (of all sheets, of at least two sheets, any suitable subset of the RF elements of such sheets, etc.) are preferably tuned to achieve this impedance response.
    - In one example, in which the wireless power receiver includes two impedance sheets, each including a connected array of dipoles, the dipole lengths of the first impedance sheet and the dipole lengths of the second impedance sheet can be treated as two separate parameters, and tuned to achieve the desired properties of substantially zero transmission and substantially unity absorption at the design wavelength (e.g., wherein the two impedance sheets can define a metamaterial, and the dipole length on the two sheets can be used as two degrees of freedom to achieve the appropriate permittivity and permeability for the desired response at the design wavelength).
    - Note that for a receiver having a sufficiently high quality factor (e.g., achieved via a sufficiently small spacing between impedance sheets), the impedance sheets can be substantially transparent to RF frequencies away from the design wavelength, thereby preventing undesired interference of the wireless power receiver with RF transmissions sufficiently distinct from the design wavelength.
  - One or more of the impedance sheets can include one or more non-linear structures.
    - Element: Non-linear structures (one or more)
      - Function: These structures can function as one or more RF-to-DC converters (e.g., wherein the one or more non-linear structures define a class F converter in cooperation with one or more inductive and/or parasitic structures of the impedance sheets, such as structures defined in and/or between the RF elements).
      - Example: the non-linear structures can include one or more diodes, transistors, and/or any other suitable structures.
      - The non-linear structures preferably enable the wireless power receiver to deliver DC output power (e.g., to one or more connected electrical loads, such as a load of and/or attached to a device with which the wireless power receiver is integrated, such as to an aerial vehicle to which the wireless power receiver is attached).
